# Foreign Key Creation Logic in Abstract Table

## Change Summary
- Foreign key creation for all plugin tables is now handled by generic methods in `EPM_AbstractTable`.
- The method `createForeignKeys` ensures foreign keys are only added if they do not already exist, preventing duplicate constraint errors.
- All table classes use this centralized logic for DRYness and consistency.

## Impact
- Prevents duplicate foreign key errors during table creation and migration.
- Ensures all foreign key relationships are defined in one place and are easy to maintain.
- Makes it easier to add or update foreign key relationships for new or existing tables.

## Developer Notes
- When adding a new table/model, define foreign key relationships in the model's `getFieldDefinitions()` and use the abstract table's `createForeignKeys` method.
- Always use the generic table and foreign key creation logic in `EPM_AbstractTable` for new tables.

# Estate Planning Manager Plugin - Fixes and Improvements Summary

## Issue Resolution

### Original Problem
The user reported an error during WordPress plugin installation: "epm-data-sync not existing" indicating missing or orphaned requirements.

### Root Cause Analysis
The main plugin file (`estate-planning-manager.php`) was attempting to require several PHP class files that didn't exist, causing fatal errors during plugin activation.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Missing Class Files Created
Created the following missing class files with basic functionality:

#### Admin Classes
- **`admin/class-epm-admin.php`** - Main admin interface class
  - Adds admin menu page
  - Handles admin script/style enqueuing
  - Provides basic admin interface

#### Public Classes  
- **`public/class-epm-frontend.php`** - Frontend functionality class
  - Handles frontend script/style enqueuing
  - Manages public-facing features

- **`public/class-epm-shortcodes.php`** - Shortcode handler class
  - Registers `[epm_client_form]` shortcode
  - Registers `[epm_client_data]` shortcode
  - Provides basic shortcode functionality

- **`public/class-epm-ajax-handler.php`** - AJAX request handler class
  - Handles `epm_save_client_data` AJAX action
  - Handles `epm_load_client_data` AJAX action
  - Includes nonce verification for security

### 2. Main Plugin File Updates
Updated `estate-planning-manager.php` to:
- Only require files that actually exist
- Properly initialize all created classes
- Include both admin and public classes in the loading sequence
- Maintain proper initialization order

### 3. PHP 7.3 Compatibility Enhancements
Enhanced the security class (`includes/class-epm-security.php`):
- **`generate_secure_token()` method** - Added fallback compatibility:
  1. Primary: Uses `random_bytes()` (PHP 7.0+)
  2. Secondary: Uses `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()` (PHP 5.3+)
  3. Fallback: Uses WordPress `wp_generate_password()` function

### 4. Build System Improvements
Fixed the plugin packaging system:

#### Build Script Fix (`build-plugin.bat`)
- Added proper directory change command: `cd /d "%~dp0"`
- Ensures script runs from correct directory

#### Package Creator Fix (`create-plugin-package.php`)
- Added ZipArchive extension detection
- Implemented PowerShell Compress-Archive fallback for Windows
- Added graceful degradation when ZIP creation fails
- Provides clear error messages and alternatives

### 5. Documentation Updates
Updated all documentation to reflect PHP 7.3 compatibility:
- **wordpress-plugin/README.md**
- **INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md**
- **suitecrm-customizations/documentation/installation_guide.md**

## Technical Implementation Details

### Class Architecture
All created classes follow the established patterns:
- **Singleton Pattern**: Each class uses `instance()` method
- **WordPress Hooks**: Proper use of `add_action()` and `add_filter()`
- **Security**: Nonce verification for AJAX requests
- **Initialization**: Proper `init()` method structure

### File Structure Maintained
```
estate-planning-manager/
├── estate-planning-manager.php     # Main plugin file (updated)
├── admin/
│   ├── class-epm-admin.php         # NEW - Main admin interface
│   ├── class-epm-admin-selectors.php
│   └── class-epm-admin-suggested-updates.php
├── public/
│   ├── class-epm-frontend.php      # NEW - Frontend functionality
│   ├── class-epm-shortcodes.php    # NEW - Shortcode handlers
│   └── class-epm-ajax-handler.php  # NEW - AJAX handlers
├── includes/
│   ├── class-epm-security.php      # UPDATED - PHP 7.3 compatibility
│   └── [other existing files]
└── [other directories]
```

### Security Considerations
- All new classes include proper WordPress security practices
- AJAX handlers include nonce verification
- Input sanitization using WordPress functions
- Proper capability checks for admin functions

## Testing Results
