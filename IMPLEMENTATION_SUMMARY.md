# Estate Planning Manager - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

The Estate Planning Manager is a comprehensive WordPress plugin that converts spreadsheet-based estate planning records into a multi-user database application with SuiteCRM integration. The system provides secure data management, PDF generation, and selective data sharing capabilities while maintaining PIPEDA compliance.

## Architecture Overview

The plugin follows WordPress best practices with a modular, object-oriented architecture:

### Core Components

1. **Database Layer** (`EPM_Database`)
   - Handles all database operations
   - Creates and manages custom tables for different data sections
   - Provides secure data access methods
   - Uses modular table classes, each implementing a common `TableInterface`.
   - All table classes are registered in a central `TableFactory` for automatic creation and population.
   - All user data tables include both `suitecrm_guid` and `wp_record_id` fields for cross-platform sync.

2. **Security Layer** (`EPM_Security`)
   - Implements data encryption for sensitive information
   - Manages user permissions and access controls
   - Ensures PIPEDA compliance

3. **SuiteCRM Integration** (`EPM_SuiteCRM_API`)
   - Bidirectional data synchronization
   - Suggested updates management
   - Contact and record management
   - Robust logging of all sync operations and errors
   - Supports background and scheduled sync jobs for ongoing data consistency
   - Extensible for future platforms (e.g., FrontAccounting) by adding new GUID fields and sync adapters

4. **PDF Generation** (`EPM_PDF_Generator`)
   - Dynamic PDF creation from database records
   - Customizable templates
   - Selective data export capabilities

5. **Audit Logging** (`EPM_Audit_Logger`)
   - Comprehensive activity tracking
   - Security event monitoring
   - Compliance reporting

6. **Static Analysis Compatibility**
   - Provides a `wp-stubs.php` file with stubs for all major WordPress functions and classes, including a comprehensive `wpdb` class, to silence static analysis errors (e.g., Intelephense).

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

1. **epm_clients** - Client master records
2. **epm_basic_personal** - Personal information
3. **epm_bank_accounts** - Banking information
4. **epm_investments** - Investment accounts
5. **epm_real_estate** - Property records
6. **epm_insurance** - Insurance policies
7. **epm_legal_documents** - Legal document references
8. **epm_emergency_contacts** - Emergency contact information
9. **epm_suggested_updates** - SuiteCRM sync suggestions
10. **epm_sync_log** - Synchronization history
11. **epm_audit_log** - Activity audit trail
12. **epm_key_contacts** - Key contact information
13. **epm_family_contacts** - Family contact information

### Security Features

- Encrypted storage for sensitive data (account numbers, SSNs)
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging for all data access
- Secure data sharing mechanisms

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-User Database Application
- Converted spreadsheet tabs into database tables
- Implemented user roles (Estate Client, Financial Advisor)
- Secure multi-user access with proper permissions
- Modular table classes and TableFactory for maintainability and extensibility

### 2. SuiteCRM Integration
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Data flows both ways between WordPress and SuiteCRM
- **Suggested Updates**: System compares data and suggests updates
- **Contact Management**: Automatic contact creation and updates
- **Custom Modules**: Bank accounts, investments, real estate, insurance
- **Cross-system GUIDs**: All user data tables include both `suitecrm_guid` and `wp_record_id` fields
- **Robust Logging**: All sync operations and errors are logged
- **Background/Scheduled Sync**: Supports background and scheduled sync jobs
- **Extensible**: Architecture supports future platforms (e.g., FrontAccounting)

### 3. PDF Generation System
- **Dynamic Templates**: Generate PDFs from database records
- **Selective Export**: Users can choose which data to include
- **Multiple Formats**: Complete estate plan, financial summary, etc.
- **Privacy Controls**: Exclude sensitive information as needed

### 4. Admin Interface
- **Data Selectors**: Choose which fields to include in exports
- **Suggested Updates**: Review and approve SuiteCRM changes
- **Settings Management**: Configure SuiteCRM connection and options
- **Audit Reports**: View system activity and changes

### 5. Security & Compliance
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive fields encrypted at rest
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Complete activity tracking
- **PIPEDA Compliance**: Privacy controls and data handling

### 6. Static Analysis Compatibility
- **wp-stubs.php**: Stubs for all major WordPress functions and classes, including `wpdb`, to silence static analysis errors

### 7. Modular UI for All Sections (June 2025)
- **Requirement:** Every major section (Personal, Banking, Investments, Insurance, Real Estate, Scheduled Payments, Autos, Personal Property, Emergency Contacts) must have its own dedicated view class for both form and data rendering. The main shortcode handler (`EPM_Shortcodes`) delegates all rendering to these classes. No legacy or inline rendering remains.
- **Change Driver:** UI maintainability, testability, and future-proofing. (Chat, June 2025)

### 8. Unit Tests for Modular UI
- **Requirement:** Unit tests must cover that each section's view class is used for rendering, and that the main shortcode handler does not perform inline rendering for any section.
- **Change Driver:** Refactor verification and test coverage. (Chat, June 2025)

### 9. Recent Changes: Multi-Record Section UI (June 2025)

#### Requirement (Old):
- Each section displayed only a single record or a two-row table, with no clear support for multiple records or add/edit/delete per user.

#### Requirement (New):
- Each section now displays a summary table with multiple rows (one per record, if any), with human-readable column headers.
- An "Add New" button is shown for owners, allowing new records to be added.
- Edit/Delete actions are available for owners only.
- When a section is shared, users with whom it is shared see a read-only view (no add/edit/delete buttons).
- All section view classes now use a common `renderSectionView()` method from `AbstractSectionView` for consistent UI and logic.

#### Justification:
- Supports robust, multi-record, and shareable section logic as required.
- Improves usability and clarity for both owners and shared users.
- Ensures compliance with modularity, SOLID, and MVC principles.

#### Test Coverage:
- Added/updated unit tests in `tests/test-section-multirecord-ui.php` to verify:
  - Table and add button appear for owners
  - Add button does not appear for shared/read-only users
  - Table headers are human-readable and match the data

### 7. Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Unit and Integration Tests**: Comprehensive PHPUnit test suite for all modular table classes, sync logic, and user/admin features
- **Test Coverage**: Table creation, default data population, sync logic, sharing/invite logic, and static analysis compatibility
